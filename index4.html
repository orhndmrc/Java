<h><u>Linear functions</u></h>
  <div class="success">
    These are functions of the form:
    y = m x + b,
    where m and b are constants. A typical use for linear functions is converting from one quantity or set of units to another. Graphs of these
    functions are straight lines. m is the slope and b is the y intercept. If m is positive then the line rises to the right and if m is negative
    then the line falls to the right.

<h><u>Quadratic functions</u></h>
<div class="faith">
    These are functions of the form:
    y = a x 2+ b x + c,
    where a, b and c are constants. Their graphs are called parabolas. This is the next simplest type of function after the linear function.
    Falling objects move along parabolic paths. If a is a positive number then the parabola opens upward and if a is a negative number
    then the parabola opens downward.

<h><u>Power functions</u></h>
<div class="effort">
    These are functions of the form:
    y = a x b,
    where a and b are constants. They get their name from the fact that the variable x is raised to some power. Many physical laws (e.g. the gravitational force as a function of distance between two
    objects, or the bending of a beam as a function of the load on it) are in the form of power functions. We will assume that a = 1 and look at several cases for b:
    The power b is a positive integer. See the graph to the right. When x = 0 these functions are all zero. When x is big and positive they are
    all big and positive. When x is big and negative then the ones with even powers are big and positive while the ones with odd powers are big
    and negative.</div>

<h><u>Polynomial functions</u></h>
<div class="style">

    These are functions of the form:
    y = an · x n + an −1 · x n −1 +  …  + a2 · x 2 + a1 · x + a0,
    where an, an −1,  … , a2, a1, a0 are constants. Only whole number powers of x are allowed. The highest power of x that occurs is called
    the degree of the polynomial. The graph shows examples of degree 4 and degree 5 polynomials. The degree gives the maximum number
    of “ups and downs” that the polynomial can have and also the maximum number of crossings of the x axis that it can have.
