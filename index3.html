    <p>The range of a function is the complete set of all possible resulting values of the dependent variable (y, usually), after we have substituted the domain.

        In plain English, the definition means:

        The range is the resulting y-values we get after substituting all the possible x-values. </p>

    <h2 >How to find the domain</h2>
    <ul class="myStyle2">
        <li>The range of a function is the spread of possible y-values (minimum y-value to maximum y-value) </li>
        <li>Substitute different x-values into the expression for y to see what is happening. (Ask yourself: Is y always
            positive? Always negative? Or maybe not equal to certain values?) </li>
        <li>Make sure you look for minimum and maximum values of y. </li>
        <li>Draw a sketch! In math, it's very true that a picture is worth a thousand words </li>

    </ul>
</div>
<h3>Finding domain and range without using a graph</h3>
<p>It's always a lot easier to work out the domain and range when reading it off the graph (but we must make sure
    we zoom in and out of the graph to make sure we see everything we need to see). However, we don't always have access
    to graphing software, and sketching a graph usually requires knowing about discontinuities and so on first anyway.

    As meantioned earlier, the key things to check for are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>There are no negative values under a square root sign </li>
    <li>There are no zero values in the denominator (bottom) of a fraction </li>
</ol>
