<p>In mathematics, a function is a relation between sets that associates to every element of a first set exactly one element of the second set.
    Typical examples are functions from integers to integers or from the real numbers to real numbers.</p>

<p>The idea of a function was developed in the seventeenth century. During this time, Rene Descartes (1596-1650), in his book Geometry (1637), used the concept to describe many mathematical relationships.
    The term "function" was introduced by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) almost fifty years after the publication of Geometry. The idea of a function was further formalized by Leonhard Euler (pronounced "oiler" 1707-1783) who introduced the notation for a function,
    y = f(x).
